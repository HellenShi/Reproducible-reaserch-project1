## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Set a directory
```{r}
setwd("/Users/Apple/data/cousera5week2project")
```
##Question1
Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
```{r}
data_activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```
##Question2
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
1.Remove missing value
```{r}
data_activity_rm<-subset(data_activity,data_activity$steps!="NA")
```
2.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
data_activity_sum<-tapply(data_activity_rm$steps,data_activity_rm$date,sum)
```
3.Reshape the dataset
```{r}
data_activity_sum<-as.data.frame(data_activity_sum)
```
4.Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
plot(data_activity_sum,type="h",xlab="day",ylab="steps",col="dark red",lwd=5)
```
##Question3
Mean and median number of steps taken each day
```{r}
data_activity_mean<-tapply(data_activity_rm$steps,data_activity_rm$date,mean)
plot(data_activity_mean,type = "h",xlab="day",ylab="mean steps",col="dark red",lwd=5)
```
##Question4
Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
```{r}
data_activity_mean1<-as.data.frame(data_activity_mean)
library(dplyr)
data_activity_mean1$y<-rownames(data_activity_mean1)
data_activity_average<-merge(data_activity_mean1,data_activity,by.x="y",by.y="date")
colnames(data_activity_average)<-c("datetime","mean","step","interval")
data_activity_average$datetime<-as.Date(data_activity_average$datetime)
plot(data_activity_average$datetime,data_activity_average$mean,type = "l")
```
##Question5
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
data_activity_max<-tapply(data_activity$steps,data_activity$date,max)
data_activity_max<-as.data.frame(data_activity_max)
data_activity_max$datetime<-rownames(data_activity_max)
```
##Question6
Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
sum(!complete.cases(data_activity))
```
2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated.
```{r}
library(reshape2)
install.packages("Hmisc")
library(Hmisc)
data_activity_rs<-dcast(data_activity,interval~date,value.var="steps")
a<-colnames(data_activity_rs)[2:61]
for (i in a) {impute(data_activity_rs$i,mean)}
```

##Question7
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r}
library(reshape2)
data_activity1<-melt(data_activity_rs,id="interval",variable.name = "date",value.name ="steps")
data_activity_total<-tapply(data_activity1$steps, data_activity$date, sum)
data_activity_total<-as.data.frame(data_activity_total)
data_activity_total$time<-rownames(data_activity_total)
ggplot(data = data_activity_total,aes(time,data_activity_total))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.3,colour="red",size=0.25)
```

##Question8
Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels weekday and weekend indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
2.Reshape the original data,creat a new one that can compare the same interval in different day
```{r}
data_activity_inter<-dcast(data_activity,date~interval,value.var="steps")
```
3.Add a new col which indicate whether the date is a weekend
```{r}
data_activity_inter$week<-weekdays(as.Date(data_activity_inter$date))
week<-data_activity_inter$week=="Saturday"|data_activity_inter$week=="Sunday"
week[which(week=="FALSE")]<-"weekdays"
week[which(week!="weekdays")]<-"weekends"
data_activity_inter$week<-week
```
4.Calulate the average of per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
#remove the "NA" values
```{r}
data_activity_week<-data_activity_inter[complete.cases(data_activity_inter),]
```
5.Calulate the average of per 5-minute interval
```{r}
data_activity_week<-aggregate(data_activity_week[,2:289],list(data_activity_week[,290]),mean)
```
6.make a panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
use melt function and dcast function to reshape the data
```{r}
colnames(data_activity_week)[1]<-"week"
panel_data<-melt(data_activity_week,id<-"week",variable.name = "interval",value.name = "mean_steps")
panel_data1<-dcast(panel_data,interval~week,value.var="mean_steps")
```
make a plot
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(4,4,2,1))
plot(x=panel_data1$interval,y=panel_data1$weekdays,xlab="interval",ylab="weekdays")
plot(x=panel_data1$interval,y=panel_data1$weekends,xlab="interval",ylab="weekends")
```
